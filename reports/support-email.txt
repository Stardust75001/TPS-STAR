Subject: Delivery failure — "554 5.7.1 Relay access denied" for hello@thepetsociety.fr

Hi OVH / Mail Admin,

We attempted to deliver an automated report from hello@thepetsociety.paris and received a permanent bounce with the message below. Please can you check the receiving configuration for thepetsociety.fr and advise why the RCPT was rejected?

What to check on your side:
- Confirm that the mailbox hello@thepetsociety.fr exists and is active on the OVH service.
- Confirm mx1.mail.ovh.net (188.165.36.237), mx2.mail.ovh.net and mx3.mail.ovh.net are configured to accept mail for thepetsociety.fr and are not misrouting to a server that refuses relays.
- Check whether any ACLs or anti-spam rules are blocking relays from secureserver.net IP ranges (the sending MTA above).
- If your setup expects authenticated submission only from certain relays, please confirm the allowed relay list or advise on required SPF/ACL updates.

I have attached the original message (EML) above in case you need full headers and the raw MIME for troubleshooting. If you prefer, I can also provide additional logs or resend via an alternative relay (SendGrid) while this is investigated.

Thanks,
